### Opening CMD as an admin
> Download **platform-tools** and extract the folder somewhere, then open CMD as an **administrator**.
>
> It is recommended to keep this window open and use it throughout the entire guide.
> 
> Replace `path\to\platform-tools` with the actual path to the platform-tools folder, for example **C:\platform-tools**.
```cmd
cd path\to\platform-tools
```

### Flash the modded TWRP
> If you have the official TWRP installed, flash it through there. Otherwise use Odin.

#### Unmount all partitions
Go to TWRP > Mount > and unmount all partitions

#### Running parted
> Download the parted file and move it in the platform-tools folder, then run
```cmd
adb push parted /sbin && adb shell "chmod +x /sbin/parted" && adb shell /sbin/parted /dev/block/sda
```

#### Printing the current partition table
> Parted will print the list of partitions, userdata should be the last partition in the list.
```cmd

```

#### Creating Windows partition

```

#### Creating WinPE partition

> This is optional

> Replace **300GB** with the end value of Windows
>
> Replace **325GB** with the end value you want WinPE to have
```cmd
mkpart pe fat32 300GB 325GB
```

#### Recreating userdata
> Replace **300GB** with the end value of the Windows or WinPE partition you created above
```cmd
mkpart userdata ext4 300GB 512GB
```
