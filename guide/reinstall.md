# Running Windows on the SAMSUNG GALAXY FOLD SM-F900F

### Prerequisites
- [Windows on ARM image](https://worproject.com/esd)

- [Drivers](https://github.com/n00b69/woa-winner/releases/tag/Drivers)
  
- [Modded TWRP](https://github.com/n00b69/woa-winner/releases/tag/Recovery) (should already be installed)

### Reboot to TWRP
> Disable MTP in TWRP

#### Entering mass storage mode
```cmd
adb shell msc.sh
```

### Diskpart
```cmd
diskpart
```

#### Select the Windows volume of the phone
> Use `list volume` to find it, replace "$" with the actual number of **WINWINNER**
```diskpart
select volume $
```

#### Add letter to Windows
```cmd
assign letter x
```

#### Exit diskpart
```cmd
exit
```

#### Formatting Windows
> Go to Windows Explorer > This PC and select **WINWINNER**. Right click and format as NTFS.

### Installing Windows
> Replace `path\to\install.esd` with the actual path of install.esd (it may also be named install.wim)
```cmd
dism /apply-image /ImageFile:path\to\install.esd /index:6 /ApplyDir:X:\
```

> If you get `Error 87`, check the index of your image with `dism /get-imageinfo /ImageFile:path\to\install.esd`, then replace `index:6` with the actual index number of **Windows 11 Pro** in your image

### Installing Drivers
> Unpack the driver archive, then open the `OfflineUpdater.cmd` file

> If it asks you to enter a letter, enter the drive letter of **WINWINNER** (which should be X), then press enter

> If any errors appear under **Installing App Packages**, ignore them and continue

### Boot into Windows
Reboot your phone. If you end up in Android instead of Windows, flash the UEFI again using WOA Helper.

#### Setting up Windows
> Your device will now set up Windows. This will take some time. It will eventually reboot, and after that the initial setup (oobe) should launch.

> [!Note]
> To skip the Microsoft Account login, use "g" for the email and password. Windows will then let you make a local account

## Finished!
